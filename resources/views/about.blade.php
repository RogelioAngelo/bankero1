          <h3 class="mb-4">OUR STORY</h3>
          <p class="fs-6 fw-medium mb-4">Four young entrepreneurs — Daryl, Al Fadhl, Philip, and Rogelio — noticed how difficult it was for students like them to find affordable clothes online. They decided to build eThriftHub, a website where people could easily buy and sell second-hand fashion. Daryl focused on the coding and design of the site, Al Fadhl took charge of promoting it on social media, Philip handled finances and seller partnerships, while Rogelio curated the best items to feature on the homepage. Their shared goal was to make thrift shopping fun, easy, and eco-friendly.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">After launching, they uploaded clothes from their own closets and invited classmates to join. When Al Fadhl’s promotional video went viral, eThriftHub gained hundreds of users in just a few days. They added reward points, flash sales, and a clean interface that kept users coming back. What started as a small idea among friends quickly turned into a growing business — showing that with creativity and teamwork, they could turn their passion into a real digital success.</p>

            <p>eThriftHub is a student-founded startup created by four young innovators — Daryl, Al Fadhl, Philip, and Rogelio — who share a passion for sustainable fashion and digital solutions. The company was born out of a simple problem: how to make thrift shopping more accessible, organized, and fun. By combining technology, creativity, and environmental awareness, they built an online platform where users can buy and sell second-hand clothes easily and affordably.

As a growing e-commerce company, eThriftHub is not just about fashion — it’s about community, sustainability, and innovation. The platform supports eco-conscious living by giving clothes a second life and helping people save money while making a positive impact on the planet. From a small idea among friends, eThriftHub is now building a digital thrift movement for the future.</p>
